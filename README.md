## Thoughts

1. prefer light text on dark background

2. I[logo](ben2.jpg)

3. I am totally out of the loop on fonts. I know they're super cool and influence readability. And also give some emotional context.I only remember really old ones like Times Ariel, Helvetica. Need advice! :)

4. We need to implement whatever you did in our alt-text talk that made PgDn always go to the next slide, rather than adding info to the current slide sometimes.
