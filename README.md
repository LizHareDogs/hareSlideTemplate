## Thoughts

1. prefer light text on dark background

2. ![logo](img/ben2.jpg)

3. I am totally out of the loop on fonts. I know they're super cool and influence readability. And also give some emotional context. I only remember really old ones like Times, Ariel, Helvetica. Need advice! :)
  - Used Red Hat Text with guidance from the axe-con 2020 talk [Don't Believe the Type!](https://youtu.be/h8IOqUl1zII?t=1029) by [The Readibility Group](https://medium.com/the-readability-group)

4. We need to implement whatever you did in our alt-text talk that made PgDn always go to the next slide, rather than adding info to the current slide sometimes.
